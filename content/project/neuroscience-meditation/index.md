The neuroscience of meditation has been a hot topic in research in the recent years. Many have found structural and functional changes after short-term and long-term meditation. Applied research in clinical fields have also established evidence of the postiive effects of meditataion on mental health. 

My interest in neuroscience of meditation lies in the mechanisms behind these changes and benefits. Specifically, I investigate neural patterns and the dynamics between the brain, behavior, and mind.
